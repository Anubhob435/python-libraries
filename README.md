# Python Libraries Repository

Welcome to my **Python Libraries Repository**, where I will be uploading code snippets and tutorials on various popular Python libraries. This repository is aimed at helping others explore and learn about different Python libraries through hands-on examples and practical use cases.

## 🚀 Libraries to Explore

Here is a list of the libraries you'll find in this repository, along with a brief description of each:

1. **NumPy** - A powerful library for numerical computing with arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions.
   
2. **Pandas** - A data manipulation and analysis library, great for working with structured data such as tables and time series.

3. **Matplotlib** - A plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

4. **TensorFlow** - An open-source platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence, widely used for deep learning models.

5. **PyTorch** - A flexible deep learning framework that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment.

6. **Requests** - A simple yet elegant HTTP library for Python, perfect for making web requests and handling API responses.

7. **Plotly** - A graphing library that makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online. Great for data visualization.

8. **Beautiful Soup** - A library for web scraping, used to pull the data out of HTML and XML files.

9. **Pygame** - A set of Python modules designed for writing video games, making it easy to create engaging graphics, sounds, and animations.

10. **spaCy** - An industrial-strength NLP (Natural Language Processing) library, great for working with text data and understanding human language.
